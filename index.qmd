# Preface

## Content and Goals of this Book

This book collects personal notes during reading of Statistical
Rethinking by Richard McElreath. I am using the [second
edition](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)
published 2020 by [CRC Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Press)
an imprint of Routledge of the Taylor & Francis Group. Additionally I am
using [Statistical Rethinking
2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus),
the most recent set of free YouTube video lectures.

You can find other material on Richards [website about the
book](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Of special
interest for me are the
[brms+tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) and the
[Stan+tidyverse](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)
conversion of his code. As I am not very experienced with R and
completely new to Bayesian statistics and their tools this additional
material is for me also very challenging. I am planning to read them
simultaneously and will dedicate parallel chapters for their approaches.
Chapters with the

-   suffix `a` refers to the original book,
-   suffix `b` to the brms conversion and
-   suffix `c` to the Stan conversion.

My text consists mostly of quotes from the 2020 book edition or from the
text of the video lectures 2023. Sometimes I made minor editing (e.g.,
shorting the text), but almost all of my text of this Quarto book are
not mine, but is coming from the book or video lectures by Richard
McElreath. Therefore I am not going to indicate these quotes and I am
also not using exact text snippets for my replications.

I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also to
change the values of parameters to observe their influences. Sometimes I
am changing the code myself to tidyverse conventions. Especially when it
comes to plotting I try use
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) instead
the base plotting system I have no experience at all.

As this is my first book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) instead of
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) I am using these notes
also to learn Quarto. Therefore you will find sometimes remarks to my
Quarto experiences.

## Warning

I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
be become explicit and explain all my learning more carefully. Please
keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner. In spite of replicating most of the content it may contain many
mistakes. All these misapprehensions and errors are my responsibility.
:::

If you find errors please do not hesitate to write issues or PRs on my
[GitHub site](https://github.com/petzi53/statistical-rethinking-2-2023).
I really appreciate it to learn from more experienced R users! It
shortens the learning paths of self-directed learners.

## Package Installation {.unnumbered}

In contrast to the sparse and partly outdated remarks in the book use
the installation section from the `rethinking` [package at
GitHub](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking#installation "Installation of 'rethinking' package").

### Step 1

From the three steps I had already successfully installed the first one
(`rstan` and the `C++` toolchain), so I had no need to follow the
detailed instructions of the `rstan` installation at
<https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html>.

### Step 2

To install the `cmdstanr` package I visited
<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>. This is an addition to my previous
installation with the older version (2nd ed., 2022). As I installed the
latest beta version of `cmdstanr` the first time I also needed to
compile the libraries with `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`.

To check the result of my installation I ran
`check_cmdstan_toolchain()`.

```{r}
#| label: install-cmdstanr
#| eval: false

install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()

```

The command for downloaded `cmdstanr` did not install the vignettes,
which take a long time to build, but they are always available online at
<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/>.

The vignette [Getting started with
CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) also
recommend to load the `bayesplot` and `posterior` packages, which are
used later in the `CmdStanR`-examples. But I believe these two packages
are not necessary if you just plan to stick with the book.

### Step 3

Once the infrastructure is installed one can install the packages used
by the book. With the exception of rethinking --- the companion package
of the book -- they can all be downloaded from CRAN.

I had already devtools installed, therefore I deleted it from the list
of installed packages.

```{r}
#| label: install-packages
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("coda","mvtnorm", "loo","dagitty","shape"))
devtools::install_github("rmcelreath/rethinking")

```

## Get Code Examples

Go to the [book website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)
and download the [R code
examples](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) for the book.

```{r}
#| label: download-code-examples
#| eval: false

dir.create("R")
download.file("http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt", "R/code.R")

```

::: {.callout-caution style="color: orange;"}
## Caution

There are big differences between the code snippets of the 2nd edition
collected in [code.txt](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) and the
new version preparing the 3rd book version. These new code snippets can
be found in the slides and/or in the videos. I will always refer to the
place where they can be found.

Additionally you will find all the scripts supporting the animation in
the lectures at the [new 2023 github
repo](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023).
:::

The style of the code snippets is not the [tidyverse
style](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). For instance: The equal
sign `=` is not embedded between spaces but a list of variables,
separated by comas has in front and before the coma a space.

```{r}
#| label: code-style-orig
#| eval: false

sample <- c("W","L","W","W","W","L","W","L","W")
W <- sum(sample=="W") # number of W observed
L <- sum(sample=="L") # number of L observed
p <- c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1) # proportions W
ways <- sapply( p , function(q) (q*4)^W * ((1-q)*4)^L )
prob <- ways/sum(ways)
cbind( p , ways , prob )

```

I will always convert the original code style with the RStudio addin
styler package to tidyverse style: Assuming that the default value of
the style transformer is `styler::tidyverse_style()` I select the code
snippet I want to convert and call the addin which runs
`styler:::style_selection()`. The transformation of the above code
snippet results into the code below:

```{r}
#| label: code-style-new
#| eval: false

sample <- c("W", "L", "W", "W", "W", "L", "W", "L", "W")
W <- sum(sample == "W") # number of W observed
L <- sum(sample == "L") # number of L observed
p <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) # proportions W
ways <- sapply(p, function(q) (q * 4)^W * ((1 - q) * 4)^L)
prob <- ways / sum(ways)
cbind(p, ways, prob)
```

As copy & paste from the slides does not work I downloaded the PDF of
the Speaker deck slides. But still, it didn't work always. In that case
I used [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/ "App for text recognition")
and formated manually. But these copy & paste problems only arise when
using new code, prepared for the 3rd edition. With the book (2nd ed.) I
do not have problems to copy the code snippets via calibre with the ePUB
eBook version.
