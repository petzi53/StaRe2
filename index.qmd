# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note style="color: blue;"}
This is work in progress: I have finished in a first draft the first 4
chapters, e.g., $\approx 23\%$ of the book content.

I am working on a second draft where I will use [Quarto tabset
panels](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/layout.html#tabset-panel)
and include the exercises under the practice section. I will also
reformat the text by including different special callout boxes linked by
numbered and named references. This second draft has stopped within
@sec-chap04 e.g. it has finished $\approx 15\%$ of the book content.

In the second draft I have used a different organization. The following
text does not yet reflect these new callout boxes and the rules that now
apply. I have postponed to adapt the explications until I have more
experiences about their usefulness. I think this will be the case after
I have finished to reformat the end of chapter 4 with the rules of the
second draft.

### Text Passages {.unnumbered}

This book collects personal notes during reading of Statistical
Rethinking by Richard McElreath. I am using the [second
edition](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)
published 2020 by [CRC Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Press)
an imprint of Routledge of the Taylor & Francis Group. Additionally I am
using [Statistical Rethinking
2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus),
the most recent set of free YouTube video lectures.

You can find links to other material on McElreath's [website about the
book](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Of special
interest for me are the
[brms+tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) and the
[Stan+tidyverse](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)
conversion of his code. As I am not very experienced with R and
completely new to Bayesian statistics and their tools this additional
material is for me also very challenging. I am planning to read them
simultaneously (section by section) and will dedicate parallel sections
for their approaches. This has the advantage that the section numbers of
the files conform to the section numbers of the [second edition of the
printed
book](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).

Sections with the

-   header "Original" refers to the original book
-   header "Tidyverse" refers to the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**}
    conversion
-   header "Stan" refers to the {**rstan**} conversion
-   header "Reconsideration" refers to sections with my personal
    comments.

My text and code consists mostly of quotes from the - second book
edition 2020 or - from the text of Robert McElreath's video lectures
2023 or - from Solomon Kurz's tidyverse / brms version or - from Vincent
Arel-Bundock converted Stan code version.

Often I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content
in my own wording. But almost all of my text of this Quarto book are not
mine, but is coming from the resources mentioned above. Therefore I had
many times not indicated these quotes. If you follow the book or the
other resources you will note the similarities and know to which
paragraph or section I am referring. And you will also realize whenever
the text passage reflects my own thoughts. In any case I am the only
responsible person for this text, especially if I have used code from
the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted text passage.

::: callout-warning
###### Warning

I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
be become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner. In spite of replicating most of the content it may contain many
mistakes. All these misapprehensions and errors are my responsibility.
:::

### Code Chunks {.unnumbered}

Packages {**rethinking**} and {**brms**} have similar tasks. Therefore
they share a lot of identical function name. Kurz has unloaded the
{**rethinking**} package when it came to explain {**brms**} function and
to prevent name conflicts. But this approach is not efficient for the
structure of my documents where I have constantly changed between these
two packages. So I just loaded with `base::library()` only the
{**tidyverse**} meta packages with it attached nine packages:
{**dplyr**}, {**forcats**}, {**ggplot2**}, {**lubridate**}, {**purrr**},
{**readr**}, {**stringr**}, {**tibble**}, and {**tidyr**}.

Whenever I used another packages I called the function with the package
name in front with the syntax `<package name>::<function name>()`.

To prevent conflicts in chunk names, objects and variables I added the
following suffix to the end of the name:

-   suffix `a` for the original book version in the main text
-   suffix `b` for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version in the main
    text
-   suffix `c` for the {**rstan**} version in the main text (not used)
-   suffix `ea`for the book version (R Base / {**rethinking**}) of the
    exercises
-   suffix `eb`for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version of the
    exercises
-   suffix `r` for the {**rethinking**} version in the synopsis
-   suffix `s` for the Stan {**rstan**} version in the synopsis
-   suffix `t` for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version in the
    synopsis

I am not using the exact code snippets for my replications because I am
not only replicating the code to see how it works but also to change the
values of parameters to observe their influences. Especially when it
comes to plotting I try to use
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) instead
the base plotting system I have no experience at all.

As I have already some experiences with the {**tidyverse**} approach I
do not include all code snippets from Kurz's version. I am concentrating
to learn Bayesian statistics and if there are no conceptual news for me
I am not going to include the corresponding passages.

This is my first book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) instead of
[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) I am using these notes
therefore also to learn Quarto. As a result you will find sometimes
remarks or call-out blocks to my Quarto experiences.

### Synopsis {.unnumbered}

At the end of each chapter I summarize the rationale for the used
techniques. It is more than a summary because it goes into details of
code chunks. But I will leave out all supporting or illustrating
passages and focus on a holistic point of view. The code chunks are
somewhat cleaned so that the most important code snippets to understand
the technique are in the center.

This synopsis gives me another occasion to digest the main points and
try out the most important code chunks of the text. I will use the same
names for code chunks, objects and variables as in the main text but
with different suffixes (`r`, `s`, `t` instead of `a`, `b`, `c`).

## Get Code Examples {.unnumbered}

Go to the [book website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)
and download the [R code
examples](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) for the book.

```{r}
#| label: download-code-examples
#| eval: false

dir.create("R")
download.file("http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt", "R/code.R")

```

::: callout-caution
###### Caution

There are big differences between the code snippets of the 2nd edition
collected in [code.txt](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) and the
new version preparing the 3rd book version. These new code snippets can
be found in the slides and/or in the videos. I will always refer to the
place where they can be found.

Additionally you will find all the scripts supporting the animation in
the lectures at the [new 2023 github
repo](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023).
:::

The style of the code snippets is not the [tidyverse
style](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). For instance: The equal
sign `=` is not embedded between spaces but a list of variables,
separated by comas has in front and before the coma a space.

```{r}
#| label: code-style-orig
#| eval: false

sample <- c("W","L","W","W","W","L","W","L","W")
W <- sum(sample=="W") # number of W observed
L <- sum(sample=="L") # number of L observed
p <- c(0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1) # proportions W
ways <- sapply( p , function(q) (q*4)^W * ((1-q)*4)^L )
prob <- ways/sum(ways)
cbind( p , ways , prob )

```

I have converted the original code style with the RStudio addin
{**styler**} package to tidyverse style: Assuming that the default value
of the style transformer is `styler::tidyverse_style()` I selected the
code snippet I wanted to convert and called the addin which ran
`styler:::style_selection()`. As an example: The transformation of the
above code snippet resulted into the code below:

```{r}
#| label: code-style-new
#| eval: false

sample <- c("W", "L", "W", "W", "W", "L", "W", "L", "W")
W <- sum(sample == "W") # number of W observed
L <- sum(sample == "L") # number of L observed
p <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) # proportions W
ways <- sapply(p, function(q) (q * 4)^W * ((1 - q) * 4)^L)
prob <- ways / sum(ways)
cbind(p, ways, prob)
```

As copy & paste from the slides does not work I downloaded the PDF of
the Speaker deck slides. But still, it didn't work always. In that case
I used [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/ "App for text recognition")
and formatted manually. But these copy & paste problems only arise when
using new code, prepared for the 3rd edition. With the book (2nd ed.) I
do not have problems to copy the code snippets via calibre with the ePUB
eBook version.

### Setup Chunks {.unnumbered}

At first I tried to collect all necessary package to load with
`library()` in the `setup` chunk (See [Quarto equivalent to RMarkdown
setup
chunk](https://community.rstudio.com/t/quarto-equivalent-to-rmarkdown-setup-chunk/153018)).
The idea was to be able to run individual calling functions from
different packages for test purposes and not to have to run all code
chunks of the very long files. Additionally I tried to prevent conflicts
of function names with the `conflicts_prefer()` function of the
{**conflicted**} package in each setup file.

But it turned out that this was not a feasible approach: I noticed
between packages with similar purpose (in my case between
{**rethinking**} and {\*\*brms\*}) too many conflicts. Furthermore many
of these conflicts are hidden because the came from imports from other
packages.

I will therefore just load the meta package {**tidverse**} in the setup
chunks of every files. To prevent conflict with function names I will
call functions of other packages with the syntax \<package
name\>::\<function()\>. This has the additional advantage to learn from
which package the function comes from. And my aim to be able to run code
chunks separately is also possible.

I will differentiate between "base R" referring to all packages loaded
automatically after starting R and the package {**base**} itself, that
is part of the collection of "base R" packages.

If you find errors please do not hesitate to write issues or PRs on my
[GitHub site](https://github.com/petzi53/statistical-rethinking-2-2023).
I really appreciate it to learn from more experienced R users! It
shortens the learning paths of self-directed learners.

## Package Installation {.unnumbered}

In contrast to the sparse and partly outdated remarks in the book use
the installation section from the `rethinking` [package at
GitHub](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking#installation "Installation of 'rethinking' package").

### Step 1 {.unnumbered}

From the three steps I had already successfully installed the first one
(`rstan` and the `C++` toolchain), so I had no need to follow the
detailed instructions of the `rstan` installation at
<https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html>.

### Step 2 {.unnumbered}

To install the `cmdstanr` package I visited
<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>. This is an addition to my previous
installation with the older version (2nd ed., 2022). As I installed the
latest beta version of `cmdstanr` the first time I also needed to
compile the libraries with `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`.

To check the result of my installation I ran
`check_cmdstan_toolchain()`.

```{r}
#| label: install-cmdstanr
#| eval: false

install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()

```

The command for downloaded `cmdstanr` did not install the vignettes,
which take a long time to build, but they are always available online at
<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/>.

The vignette [Getting started with
CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) also
recommend to load the `bayesplot` and `posterior` packages, which are
used later in the `CmdStanR`-examples. But I believe these two packages
are not necessary if you just plan to stick with the book.

### Step 3 {.unnumbered}

Once the infrastructure is installed one can install the packages used
by the book. With the exception of rethinking --- the companion package
of the book -- they can all be downloaded from CRAN.

I had already devtools installed, therefore I deleted it from the list
of installed packages.

```{r}
#| label: install-packages
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("coda","mvtnorm", "loo","dagitty","shape"))
devtools::install_github("rmcelreath/rethinking")

```

    animations](https://github.com/petzi53/stat_rethinking_2023/tree/main/homework).
    --- I could not find the new R scripts associated with the (new)
    book text. They need to be collected from the slide lectures.
-   **Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse**:
    [brms/tidyverse-Conversion](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) of
    Statistical Rethinking using bookdown by *A Solomon Kurz*
    (2023-01-26)
-   **Functions for Learning Bayesian Inference**: Maybe I should also
    check this resource: It is an [R package to learn bayesian
    inference](https://cran.r-project.org/package=LearnBayes) with
    vignettes as short guides.

**Solutions**:

There are two different bookdown websites with book solutions:

-   [Solutions for the 1st
    edition](https://bookdown.org/bgautijonsson/statistical_rethinking_solutions/)
    by *Brynjólfur Gauti Jónsson* and
-   [Solutions for the 2nd
    edition](https://github.com/wjakethompson/sr2-solutions) by *Jake
    Thompson.*

I have also found two GitHub repos with solutions:

-   [GitHub solutions by *Taras
    Svirskyi*](https://github.com/jffist/statistical-rethinking-solutions)
    *(jffist)*
-   [GitHub solutions by William
    Wolf](https://github.com/cavaunpeu/statistical-rethinking)
    *(cavaunpeu)*
