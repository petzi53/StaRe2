# Golem of Prague

> “A golem (goh-lem) is a clay robot from Jewish folklore” ([McElreath, 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/5243560/items/NFUEVASQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5243560/items/CPFRPHX8?page=20&annotation=KPEPLRLA))

The golem stands as a metaphor for scientific models. Like in the folklore they
are made of dust (silicon chips), are very powerful but also very dumb
and therefore dangerous.

There are many remarks about philosophy of science. As I knew most of the already in its general form there is nothing more for me to learn in this chapter. I opened this file only to get
the same header numbers as in the book.
