# Golem of Prague

A golem (goh-lem) is a clay robot from Jewish folklore. It stands as a
metaphor for scientific models. Like in the folklore they are made of
dust (silicon chips), are very powerful but also very dumb and therefore
dangerous.

There is nothing more in this chapter. I opened this file only to get the same header numbers as in the book.
