This is why so much effort is devoted to <a class='glossary' title='Multiple Regression uses more than one predictor variable to simultaneously model an outcome. (Chap.5)'>multiple regression</a>, using more than one predictor variable to simultaneously model an outcome.\n\nReasons given for multiple regression models include:\n1. Statistical \"control\" for confounds\n2. Multiple and complex causation\n3. <a class='glossary' title='The importance of one variable depends upon another. For example, plants benefit from both light and water. But in the absence of either, the other is no benefit at all. If variable interact than effective inference about one variable will depend upon consideration of others. (Chap.5)'>Interaction</a> of variables\n\nIn this chapter, we begin use multiple regression to deal with simple confounds and to take multiple measurements of association. \n\n### Spurious association\n\n",
