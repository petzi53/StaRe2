I am using the [second\nedition](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)\npublished 2020 by [CRC Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_Press)\nan imprint of Routledge of the Taylor & Francis Group. Additionally I am\nusing [Statistical Rethinking\n2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus),\nthe most recent set of free YouTube video lectures.\n\nYou can find links to other material on McElreath's [website about the\nbook](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). Of special\ninterest for me are the\n[brms+tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) and the\n[Stan+tidyverse](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/)\nconversion of his code. As I am not very experienced with R and\ncompletely new to Bayesian statistics and their tools this additional\nmaterial is for me also very challenging. I am planning to read them\nsimultaneously (section by section) and will dedicate parallel sections\nfor their approaches. This has the advantage that the section numbers of\nthe files conform to the section numbers of the [second edition of the\nprinted\nbook](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).\n\n\n::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore not an\nauthoritative textbook!\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out-container\nI wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to\nbe become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.\nPlease keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a\nlearner. In spite of replicating most of the content it may contain many\nmistakes. All these misapprehensions and errors are my responsibility.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Text Passages {.unnumbered}\n\nMy text consists mostly of quotes from the first edition of Harris’\nbook. I converted my kindle book into a PDF file which I copied via the\nannotation system in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) into my Quarto\nfiles.\n\n::: my-example\n::: my-example-header\n::: {#exm-preface-quote}\n: Quote\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-example-container\n\n> “Bayesian inference is really just counting and comparing of possibilities.” ([McElreath, 2020, p. 20](zotero://select/groups/5243560/items/NFUEVASQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5243560/items/CPFRPHX8?page=39&annotation=JYNC25AE))\n:::\n:::\n\n\\@exm-preface-quote has links to my PDF and also to my annotation of\nthe PDF. These links are a practical way for me to get the context of\nthe quote. But as the linked PDF is saved locally at my hard disk these\nlinks do not work for you! (There is an option about [Zotero\ngroups](https://www.zotero.org/groups) to share files, but the PDF is\nnot free to use and so I can't offer this possibility.)\n\nOften I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content\nin my own wording. In this case I couldn't quote the text as it does not\nrepresent a specific annotation in my Zotero file. In this case I ended\nthe paraphrase with `(McElreath ibid.)`.\n\nIn any case most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but coming\nfrom different resources (McElreath’ book or video lectures, [Kurz’ website](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/), R help files, packages vignettes, …). Most of\nthe time I have put my own personal notes into a notes box as shown in\n@exm-preface-note.\n\n::: my-example\n::: my-example-header\n::: {#exm-preface-note}\n: Personal note\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-example-container\n::: my-note\n::: my-note-header\n::: {#cor-preface-note-example}\n: This is a personal note\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-note-container\nIn this kind of box I will write my personal thoughts and reflections.\nUsually this box will appear stand-alone (without the wrapping example\nbox).\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for this text, especially\nif I have used code from the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted\ntext passage.\n\nSections with the\n\n-   header \"Original\" refers to the original book\n-   header \"Tidyverse\" refers to the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**}\n    conversion\n-   header \"Stan\" refers to the {**rstan**} conversion\n-   header \"Reconsideration\" refers to sections with my personal\n    comments.\n\n\n\n## Code Chunks {.unnumbered}\n\nPackages {**rethinking**} and {**brms**} have similar tasks. Therefore\nthey share a lot of identical function name. Kurz has unloaded the\n{**rethinking**} package when it came to explain {**brms**} function and\nto prevent name conflicts. But this approach is not efficient for the\nstructure of my documents where I have constantly changed between these\ntwo packages. So I have used the advice \"Qualifying namespace\" from the [Google’s R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). \n\nWhenever I used a function I called the function with the package name in front with the syntax `<package name>::<function name>()`. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names\nfrom different packages it helps to learn (or remember) which function\nbelongs to which package. I think this justifies the small overhead and\nhelps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous package\nloading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster learning the\nrelation between function and package I embrace the package name with\ncurly brakes and format it in bold.\n\nTo prevent conflicts in chunk names, objects and variables I added the\nfollowing suffix to the end of the name:\n\n-   suffix `a` for the original book version\n-   suffix `b` for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**} version\n\nTo distinguish the models I used\n\n- m<chapter-number>.<running.number>a for the original book version\n- m<chapter-number>.<running.number>b for the {**tidyverse**} / {**brms**}\n\n:::::{.my-example}\n:::{.my-example-header}\n:::::: {#exm-preface-model-name}\n: Name of models\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-example-container}\n\n- The model name `m4.3a` refers to the third {**rethinking**} model in the fourth chapter.\n- The model name `m2.1b` refers to the first {**tidyberse**}/{**brms**} model in the second chapter.\n- To refer to graphics, code snippets etc. I have the dot replaced by a dash, for instance `#| label: chap04-precis2-m4-1a` is the chunk label in the fourth chapter using the second version of the `precis` summary for model `m4.1a`.\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\nI am not using the exact code snippets for my replications because I am\nnot only replicating the code to see how it works but also to change the\nvalues of parameters to observe their influences. \n\nMy focus is on learning Bayesian statistics. Therefore I have not replicated all code snippets from Kurz’ version in case they have no relation to Bayesian statistics but are just graphics explaining general procedures.\n\nThis is my first book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) instead of\n[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) I am using these notes\ntherefore also to learn Quarto. As a result you will find sometimes\nremarks or call-out blocks to my Quarto experiences.\n\n## Get Code Examples {.unnumbered}\n\nGo to the [book website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)\nand download the [R code\nexamples](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt) for the book.\n\n***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-preface-download-code-examples lst-cap=\"Download R code for book examples (not evaluated here)\"}\ndir.create(\"R\")\ndownload.file(\"http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt\", \"R/code.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n***\n\nThe style of the code snippets is not the [tidyverse\nstyle](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). For instance: The equal\nsign `=` is not embedded between spaces or a list of variables,\nseparated by comas has in front and before the coma a space.\n\nI have converted the original code style with the RStudio addin\n{**styler**} package to tidyverse style: Assuming that the default value\nof the style transformer is `styler::tidyverse_style()` I selected the\ncode snippet I wanted to convert and called the addin which ran\n`styler:::style_selection()`. See @exm-preface-tab-example\n\nTo facilitate the comparison of {**rethinking**} and {**tidyberse**}/{**brms**} code I have used tabs. This has the disadvantage that one cannot jump directly to links under the tabs. In this case I have linked to the wrapping example and indicated the specific tab where the R code can be found. With graphic it is easier, because if you hover over the links you see the original graphic in a smaller overlay. This is very convenient for comparison of two different graphics (for instance the same graphic with {**rethinking**} versus {**tidyverse**} coding). Try it out and hover over @fig-preview-code-style-tidyverse.\n\n\n:::::{.my-example}\n:::{.my-example-header}\n:::::: {#exm-preface-tab-example}\n: Comparison of code snippets in {**rethinking**} and {**tidyverse**} style\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-example-container}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n###### Original\n\n:::::{.my-r-code}\n:::{.my-r-code-header}\n:::::: {#cnj-code-name-a}\na: Code snippet 2.7 (rethinking style)\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-r-code-container}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## R code 2.7 ###############\n# analytical calculation\nW <- 6\nL <- 3\ncurve( dbeta( x , W+1 , L+1 ) , from=0 , to=1 )\n# quadratic approximation\ncurve( dnorm( x , 0.67 , 0.16 ) , lty=2 , add=TRUE )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Globe tossing data with n = 9 tosses and w = 6 waters.

In RStudio one can detect these lines easy as they are displayed as bold headers. This is very helpful for the navigation inside the Quarto file.\n\nAs copy & paste from the slides does not work I downloaded the PDF of\nthe Speaker deck slides. But still, it didn't work always. In that case\nI used [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/ \"App for text recognition\")\nand formatted manually. But these copy & paste problems only arise when\nusing new code, prepared for the 3rd edition. With the book (2nd ed.) I\ndo not have problems to copy the code snippets via [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) with the ePUB eBook version.\n\n\n## Package Installation {.unnumbered}\n\nIn contrast to the sparse and partly outdated remarks in the book use\nthe installation section from the `rethinking` [package at\nGitHub](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking#installation \"Installation of 'rethinking' package\").\n\n### Step 1 {.unnumbered}\n\nFrom the three steps I had already successfully installed the first one\n(`rstan` and the `C++` toolchain), so I had no need to follow the\ndetailed instructions of the `rstan` installation at\n<https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html>.\n\n### Step 2 {.unnumbered}\n\nTo install the `cmdstanr` package I visited\n<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>. This is an addition to my previous\ninstallation with the older version (2nd ed., 2022). As I installed the\nlatest beta version of `cmdstanr` the first time I also needed to\ncompile the libraries with `cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()`.\n\nTo check the result of my installation I ran\n`check_cmdstan_toolchain()`.\n\n***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-preview-install-cmdstanr lst-cap=\"Install the `cmdstanr` package (not evaluated here)\"}\ninstall.packages(\"cmdstanr\", repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", getOption(\"repos\")))\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan()\ncmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()\n```\n:::\n\n\n***\n\nThe command for downloaded `cmdstanr` did not install the vignettes,\nwhich take a long time to build, but they are always available online at\n<https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/>.\n\nThe vignette [Getting started with\nCmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) also\nrecommend to load the `bayesplot` and `posterior` packages, which are\nused later in the `CmdStanR`-examples. But I believe these two packages\nare not necessary if you just plan to stick with the book.\n\n### Step 3 {.unnumbered}\n\nOnce the infrastructure is installed one can install the packages used\nby the book. With the exception of rethinking --- the companion package\nof the book -- they can all be downloaded from CRAN.\n\nI had already devtools installed, therefore I deleted it from the list\nof installed packages.\n\n***\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-preview-install-packages lst-cap=\"Install packages (not evaluated here)\"}\ninstall.packages(c(\"coda\",\"mvtnorm\", \"loo\",\"dagitty\",\"shape\"))\ndevtools::install_github(\"rmcelreath/rethinking\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n***\n\n\n## Solutions\n\nThere are several websites with book solutions. They have different quality and not always exhaustive. For the purpose of comparison I have consulted mostly the following two collection of solutions:\n\n-   [Statistical Rethinking: Slution (2nd edition)](https://sr2-solutions.wjakethompson.com/) by [Jake\n    Thompson](https://github.com/wjakethompson). It seems to me that he is a very experienced data scientist and he also using the {**tidyverse**} style and the {**brms**} package.\n- [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.erikkusch.com/courses/rethinking/) by [Erik Kusch](https://www.erikkusch.com/).\n- [A Short Guide to Statistical Rethinking²](https://rgoswami.me/posts/some-sol-sr2/) by [Rohit Goswami](https://rgoswami.me/about/).\n- \n\nI have also found two GitHub repos with solutions.
