## Original

Since most correlations do not indicate causal relationships, we need
tools for distinguishing mere association from evidence of causation.
This is why so much effort is devoted to
`r glossary("multiple regression")`, using more than one predictor
variable to simultaneously model an outcome.

Reasons given for multiple regression models include: 1. Statistical
"control" for confounds 2. Multiple and complex causation 3.
`r glossary("Interaction")` of variables

In this chapter, we begin use multiple regression to deal with simple
confounds and to take multiple measurements of association.
